### About me 🧑‍💻

Hi, I'm Cédric, a software developer who loves to create cool stuff and also likes to quibble in operating systems.<br />
Alongside my work, I am also a student specializing in computer systems and network security.
I also have database knowledge, some agile methodologies and analysis.

I mainly work with Java and its frameworks, but also with ReactJS, Laravel and others.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring the intricacies of Linux systems as well as tinkering with Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
