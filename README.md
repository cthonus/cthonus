### About me 🧑‍💻

Hi, I'm Cédric, a software developer who loves creating cool stuff and enjoys delving into operating systems.

In addition to my work, I'm also a student specializing in computer systems and network security. I have knowledge in databases, agile methodologies, and analysis.

I primarily work with Java and its frameworks, but I'm also experienced with ReactJS, Laravel, and other technologies.

During my free time, I enjoy exploring the intricacies of Linux systems and tinkering with Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
